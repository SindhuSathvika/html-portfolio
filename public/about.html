<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am someone who’s always been determined and passionate about technology. Whether it's web development, artificial intelligence, or machine learning, I love diving deep into these fields to expand my knowledge and grow my skills.
   No matter how complex things get, I stay focused on my goals and enjoy the challenge of figuring things out.</p>

<p>One thing that really helps me is my ability to stay calm under pressure.
   I'm consistent in how I approach my work and personal development, always aiming to stay organized and keep pushing forward.
   It’s important for me to maintain that balance, so I can steadily progress without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I have a strong love for music and movies—especially Pixar films and Marvel’s sci-fi universe.
   I also enjoy playing chess and badminton, which give me a great mix of strategic thinking and staying physically active. 
   These hobbies allow me to keep a healthy balance between my creative side and my tech interests.
